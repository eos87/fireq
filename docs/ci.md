# [test.superdesk.org](https://test.superdesk.org)

**Uses login via Github, also people must be in [Superdesk Organisation][sd-people] to get access here.**

[sd-people]: https://github.com/orgs/superdesk/people

The main page contains the list of enabled repositories.

A repository page contains a list of **Pull Requests** and **Branches** with related links:
- `[instance]` link to the test instance (the instance build status is indicated by colours: green is ok, orange is build in progress, red is a failure)
- `[latest logs]` link to the latest ci logs
- `[deploy]` runs only deployment step
- `[restart]` runs failed/waiting steps if they are exist or runs all steps
- `[restart all]` runs all steps (including `build` step)
- `[reset db]` resets databases for the test instance

When you press them it redirects you to according log directory and you can refresh proper file (like `build.log`, `www.log`, `reset.log`) to see what happens here.

## Test instance
### Emails
**There are no real emails (by default),** all emails are stored in log files and can be found by url: `<domain>/mail`:
- https://sd-master.test.superdesk.org/mail/

### Server logs
Logs for particular instance can be found by url `<domain>/logs`:
- https://sd-master.test.superdesk.org/logs/

### Docs
Docs are generated for `superdek-core` and can be found by url `<domain>/docs/`:
- https://sds-master.test.superdesk.org/docs/

### Screenshots for failed e2e tests
When e2e test fails it saves screenshot for failed step, so it could give some insight.
- https://test.superdesk.org/logs/screenshots/

### Init
Environment variables can be defined in **init files**, they are stored in separate branch [init][init]. Proper file invokes after build step. You can update existing files or [create new one][init-new] via github interface.

For example, we have `new-feature` branch in `superdesk/superdesk` repo, filename should be `<instance name>.sh`, so `sd-newfeature.sh`, file should be like this:
```sh
# sd-newfeature.sh
{{>init/sd.sh}}

cat <<"EOF" >> {{config}}
# there are variables
WEBHOOK_PERSONALIA_AUTH=1234
EOF
```
After updating or creation, we should press an according `[deploy]` button.

Some examples:
 - [sd-master.sh](https://github.com/superdesk/fireq/blob/init/sd-master.sh)
 - [sd-sdsite.sh](https://github.com/superdesk/fireq/blob/init/sd-sdsite.sh)

# Github integration

After webhook is invoked by Github, `fireq` uses [Github API][gh-statuses] to post statuses.

## Minimal set of statuses
```
├─ fire:build       # build code for the proper git commit
├─ fire:www         # deploy the test instance, contains the link if successful
├─ fire:restart     # the way to restart failed (or all) steps from Github interface
```

[gh-statuses]: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/

# Admin area
You need `SSH` access to `host7.sourcefabric.org`.

All steps can be run from shell, web server just calls this scripts in background.
```sh
cd /opt/fireq       # code
./fire -h           # help messages are pretty detailed
./fire ci -h

vim config.json     # config
./fire config       # show all config values (with defaults ones)

# run ci for superdesk/superdesk master branch
./fire ci sd master
./fire ci sd master -t build -t www
./fire ci sd master --all

# run ci for superdesk/superdesk-ntb master branch
./fire ci ntb master

# reset database
./fire ci sd naspeh -t reset
# backup database
./fire lxc-db -b - sd-master  # loads $DB_HOST and $DB_NAME inside container
./fire lxc-db -b - data-sd --db-name sd-master  # backup in data container
# restore database
./fire lxc-db -cr sd-sdsite-20170503 sd-naspeh

# next two command are running by cron /etc/cron.d/fireq
./fire gh-clean # clean containers by checking Github for alive PRs and branches
./fire gh-pull  # check if ci have been runnnig for all PRs and branches

# shortcut for ssh-ing to container with no interruption and fully-worked shell
./fire lxc-ssh sd-master

[comment]:# lxc containers uses zfs
[comment]:zfs list
[comment]:ll /var/tmp/zpool.*

# container with presistent mongo and elastic, local redis is used everywhere
cat config.json | grep lxc_data
lxc ls | grep data-sd

# base container with all packages installed for CI
cat config.json | grep lxc_base
lxc ls | grep base-sd
```

`fireq.cli` uses [mustache][mustache] templates in `tpl` directory to generate straightforward bash scripts.

[mustache]: https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html

## nginx
```sh
# update nginx for ci instances
./fire ci-nginx
```
### SSL certificates
Test instances **for branches** are using SSL certificates, but they are generated manually because of [Let’s Encrypt rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/), so if you need green one:
```sh
./fire ci-nginx --live
ll /etc/nginx/certs/ci
```
Cert updates automatically at nights by `cron` (`/etc/cron.d/fireq`).

## Github statuses
`./fire ci` posts proper statuses to Github if config values are filled:
```json
"no_statuses": false
"github_basic": "token:<token>"
```

### Get token for [your application](#login-via-github)
```sh
curl -XPOST -u <username> https://api.github.com/authorizations -d '{
"client_id": "<github_id>",
"client_secret": "<github_secret>",
"note": "fireq",
"scopes": ["public_repo", "read:org"]
}'
```

### Get personal token
Create token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## fireq.web - webhook and dashboard
```sh
systemd restart fireq
cat /etc/systemd/system/fireq.service

# systemd service runs gunicorn like this
gunicorn fireq.web:app --bind localhost:8080 --worker-class aiohttp.worker.GunicornWebWorker
```

### Webhook
```
Payload URL: https://test.superdesk.org/hook
Secret: <"secret" from config.json>
Content type: application/json
```
Events **Push** and **Pull request** are supported.

### Login via Github
Fill `github_id` and `github_secret` config values from [one of applications.][gh-apps]

[gh-apps]: https://github.com/organizations/superdesk/settings/applications

## Upgrade
```sh
cd /opt/fireq
git pull

# mostly needed if fireq/web.py is changed
systemd restart fireq
```

## Troubleshooting
If `[restart]` and `[restart-all]` is not working from Dashboard, then look at proper logs to find an issue.

```sh
[comment]:# Sometimes "lxc-destroy" is not working properly, because underlying ZFS
[comment]:zfs destroy lxc/sd-something
[comment]:lxc-destroy -fn sd-something

# Sometimes it needs to run "lxc-destroy" manually for some reason
lxc delete -f sd-something
```
